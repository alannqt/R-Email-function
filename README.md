# R_Email_function

This is a skeleton that make use of RDCOMClient to achieve email automation. The script is done using R, but it is possible to create a python version.
There is no well documented usage of the functions, most of the functions were discovered via trial and error. Kindly credit my work if you are using it for your use case. Thanks
